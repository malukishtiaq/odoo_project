do not understrand all this because i am not an odoo guy. but i 
 want you to keep this in daily requirements, that whenever i 
 open this project, i want to use alzain db. when i ask to start 
 odoo server etc, i want to see odoo 18 running in browser on 
 localhost, i want to see alzain db. and i want to use same data 
 in db. i do not want to create db everytime i start this 
 project. the domain where i want to serve should be consistenet 
 as well. not like today 69, yesterday it was 70.

 why dont you do this. delete all configuration. delete all old dbs. and start fresh. delete all other odoo instances. i want to keep my odoo in one pace. where odoo project is. i was testing, installing. may be that caused this multiple location issue.
